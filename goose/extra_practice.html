    <h1>Extra Practice Section 1</h1>
    <p>
    This is extra practice making HTML files and content to better assist me in my practice with learning HTML.
    Specifically this section will serve as a point of where HTML will better assist with learning about this website language. 
    I hope to better learn how to format and create new posts based on what is linked.
